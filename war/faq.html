    <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; MemeThis: an easy way to post what you find on the web to <a href="http://meme.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Meme</a></h3>
	
    <h4>FAQ</h4>
    <li>Do you store my Yahoo! password?<br/>
    No, we don't even have access to your Yahoo! password.<br/></li>
    <br/><li>What personal information do you store?<br/>
    We'll only store a key sent by Yahoo! to be able to send memes to your account. We won't store any personal information.</li>
    <br/><li>When I click on the bookmark, what information is sent to the server?<br/>
    The URL you are viewing, an identifier of your bookmarlet (so that we know to what account we should send it) and a token (used to make sure it's not someone else trying to send memes to your account).</li>
    <br/><li>If I don't like MemeThis, how do I remove it?<br/>
    Just delete it from your bookmark toolbar. You can also revoke our access to send memes to your account using the link provided by Yahoo! when you authorized us (instructions are sent to your e-mail).</li>
    <br/><li>Which browsers are supported?<br/>
    We've tested MemeThis on Firefox 3, Internet Explorer 8, Safari 4 and Opera 9.</li>
    <br/><li>Is it safe?<br/>
    Anyone who has access to your browser using your profile (i.e., anyone who can click on the bookmarklet) will be able to post to your Meme, so we don't recommend you use it on a shared computer. Apart from that, it should be pretty safe.</li>
    <br/><li>Can I see the code used to run MemeThis?<br/>
    Sure, MemeThis is free software, licensed under <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPLv3</a>. In short, this means that you can view, use and modify the code in any way you'd like, under the condition that you keep the same license. This also means that if you run your own version of a software based on MemeThis, you <em>must</em> make the source code available to <em>every</em> user. That said, the project is hosted at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/memethis/">Sourceforge</a>.</li>
